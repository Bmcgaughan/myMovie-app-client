# myMovie-app-client
 
### Movie App Client side using React

## Description

Project to display TV shows and select favorites. Ultimately will allow for searching and adding shows dynamically using external APIs. Meant to be a fun project to find new TV shows to watch while using React.

Check it out live at https://whatdoiwatch.netlify.app/



### Get Started

- Clone the project
- run npm install to install all dependancies

### Application Use

Right now the site displays shows and movies in two sliders. The top slider is for shows that are Trending as identified by The MovieDB. There is also a full list of shows.

You can click on each show to see some additional details and find shows with the same director or genre. For the next step I will try to have it recommend shows based on what you click.

You can also select favorite shows
